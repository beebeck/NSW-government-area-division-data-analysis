# NSW-government-area-division-data-analysis
I fetched the data from https://www.nsw.gov.au/education-and-training/resources/smart-and-skilled-regions where different subhurbs are allocated with their respective postcodes. I carried out the visual analysis and carried out some informative insights based on the table and available number of records there.

Insights from the analysis:
-sydney is the most subhurbed area
-New England and north west is the least subhurbed region
-Total number of subhurbs counts 429 in the data
-Sudney hasnt got any futher region classification
-futher analysis can also be carrieed out through key influencer and decomposition tree analysis
